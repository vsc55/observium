        STATUS     current
        DESCRIPTION
        "Counts configuration changes within the printer. A
        configuration change is defined to be an action that results in
        a change to any MIB object other than those that reflect status
        or level, or those that act as counters or gauges. In addition,
        any action that results in a row being added or deleted from
        any table in the Printer MIB is considered a configuration
        change. Such changes will often affect the capability of the
        printer to service certain types of print jobs. Management
        applications may cache infrequently changed configuration
        information about sub units within the printer. This object
        should be incremented whenever the agent wishes to notify
        management applications that any cached configuration
        information for this device is to be considered 'stale'. At
        this point, the management application should flush any
        configuration information cached about this device and fetch
        new configuration information.
        The following are examples of actions that would cause the
        prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented:
        - Adding an output bin
        - Changing the media in a sensing input tray
        - Changing the value of prtInputMediaType
        Note that the prtGeneralConfigChanges counter would not be
        incremented when an input tray is temporarily removed to load
        additional paper or when the level of an input device changes.
        NOTE: The above description has been modified from RFC 1759
        for clarification."

        that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value
        shall be null (0 length).
        When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its
        accompanying description must specify the encoding and
        interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the
        channel type.  prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing
        PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as
        described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values.
        The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of
        channel attributes, represented as text according to the
        following rules:
        1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization.
        2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing
        the attribute values.  Each entry consists of the following
        items, in order:
        a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z)
        represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that
        identifies a channel attribute,
        b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to
        delimit the keyword,
        c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the
        PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which
        must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII
        Line Feed code),
        d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to
        delimit the data value.
        No other octets shall be present.
        Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords are
        capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and
        since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are
        kept short.
        3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is
        represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each
        specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one
        entry for each attribute.
        4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If there are
        ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be
        specified in their definitions.
        5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text
        represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes.  However,
        other representations may be specified:
        a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains
        information not normally coded in textual form, whatever
        symbolic representation is conventionally used for the
        information should be used for encoding the
        prtChannelInformation value.  (For instance, a binary port value
        might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII
        codes.)  Such encoding must be specified in the definition of
        the value.
        b. The value may contain textual information in a character set
        other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.  (For instance, an
        identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the
        UTF-8 encoding scheme.)  Such a character set and its encoding
        must be specified in the definition of the value.
        6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation
        entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the
        PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following
        information for each entry:
        Title:        Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name',
        'Service Name', etc.
        Keyword:      The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service'
        Syntax:       The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be
        directly represented by NVT ASCII.
        Status:       'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally
        Mandatory'
        Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the
        entry may be present multiple times.
        Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other
        information required to complete the definition
        (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between
        entries).
        Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore
        unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry
        types are added."

        (i.e. the NOT-IDLE object does not contain any items), this

        "The service name or URI for this port, specified in UTF-8 (RFC

        The service name is typically a queue name.
        Compatibility Note:  At the time of publication of this MIB,
        the Microsoft tools do not support LPR queue names longer than
        32 characters.  Network administrators SHOULD NOT assign longer
        LPR queue names, to prevent interworking problems.
        Compatibility Note:  At the time of publication of this MIB,
        IETF URI Generic Syntax (RFC 3986) requires that all non-ASCII
        characters be percent-encoded, while IETF Internationalized
        Resource Identifiers (RFC 3987) permits native UTF-8 resource
        identifiers and supplies mappings to and from standard URI.
        In order to support current use of IRI and possible future
        evolution of URI (in a successor to RFC 3986) to allow non-ASCII
        characters, this object has been defined with a syntax of UTF-8
        (RFC 3629).
        Examples of well-formed service URI for print protocols
        include:
        - 'lpr://foo.example.com/public-printer' (where 'public-
        printer' is the LPR queue name portion)

        conflict, the URI value in 'ppmPortServiceNameOrURI' is
        authoritative (e.g., 'ipp://example.com:631/~smith/printer').

        'chPortTCP(37)' and 'chBidirPortTCP(38)' are NOT defined in
        IETF Printer MIB v1 (RFC 1759).
        Systems that do implement the IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805)
