--
--  This MIB describes all the printer model specific
--  objects supported by the LaserJet 2025 printer
--  when networked connected.
--
--  The following MIBs also contain objects supported
--  by a LaserJet 2025 printer:
--
--  IEEE 802.11 MIB
--  IEEE 802.1X MIB
--  rfc 2790 Host Resources MIB
--  rfc 3411 SNMP Framework MIB
--  rfc 3412 SNMP MPD MIB
--  rfc 3418 SNMP MIB
--  rfc 3805 Printer MIB
--  rfc 4022 TCP MIB
--  rfc 4293 IP MIB
--  rfc 4113 UDP MIB
--  PWG 5107.1-2005 Printer Port Monitor MIB
--
--  This MIB complies with the following RFCs:
--
--  rfc 1157 Simple Network Management Protocol
--  rfc 2578 Structure of Management Information Version 2
--
--  Notes:
--
--  1) Objects containing a string which are defined in this MIB use the
--     first two bytes to hold the symbol set used to encode the string.
--     The Roman-8 symbol set has a hex encoding of 0x0115.  Other 
--     symbol sets are listed in the PCL 5 Comparison Guide in table
--     C-1 Symbol Set Values.
--
--  2) Some of the objects included are only supported if an accessory 
--     is installed.  These accessories include:
--       MIO based accessories
--       SIMM based accessories
--       Paper handling accessories

                Additional information:
                Setting this object when the printer is not
                idle, may cause a status of <noError> to be returned, but
                the new value will not take effect until a job boundary
                is reached.  If a get is done on object before the job
                boundary is reached, the value last set will be
                returned.
                
                When the value is set to eOff, pages will not be stored
                in the printer, and in the event of a paper jam, will
                have to be reprinted.  When the value is set to eOn,
                pages will be stored until delivery, therefore, in the
                event of a paper jam, the page will be reprinted.
                
                When the value is set to eAuto, the printer will behave
                as though it is eOff when there is less than seven
                megabytes of memory installed in the printer.  When
                additional memory is installed, to total at least seven
                megabytes of RAM, the setting of eAuto will behave as

                centipoint is 1/7200 inch. Height applies only to proportional		
                fonts. Point size, in points, can be converted to font height,		
                in centipoints, by multiplying the point size by 100. The POS

                to return <noError>. ''Closest'' means		
                the smallest absolute difference.
                Additional information:
                This object refers to the font point size
                with 400 representing the smallest settable font (4) and
                99975 representing the largest settable font (999.75).
                The default of 1200 is a font point size of 12.
                
                Supported values range from 400 to 99975.  Setting to an
                unsupported value causes the printer to substitute in a
                snap value and to return
                <noError> status.
                
                The snap values are as follows:

                >=99975 snaps to 99975

                width, in centipoints, by dividing 7200 by the pitch. The POS
