    DESCRIPTION
    "This object configures how TSs will be compacted over the SHDSL Line.
	 In both mapping cases (2),(3), only the TSs connected on the E1 line will be 
	 transferred over the SHDSL Line
	 noCompaction - the whole E1 BW is reserved on the SHDSL Line, 
	             even if only part  of the TSs are actually connected.
	 noMapping - there is no mapping between the E1 TSs and the SHDSL frame TSs.
	             Therefore, E1 connected TSs are ordered in ascending order (e.g
				 E1 TSs 2, 16, 20 will occupy places 1, 2, 3 in SHDSL Line).
				 In this case, if user wants to add connection for 
				 a TS that is lower	than the existing ones on SHDSL, 
				 the TSs that are higher will have to  move. 
				 That causes breaks in service for the moved TSs. 
				 (e.g if E1 TS8 is added in the above case, 
				 TSs 16 and 20 will move, so that by the
				 end of this process, the E1 TSs 2, 8, 16, 20 will
				  be ordered in  SHDSL frame as 1, 2, 3, 4).
	 withMapping - there is a mapping between the E1 TSs and the SHDSL frame TSs.
	             Therefore, if some TSs were connected and then user wants to add
	             additional E1 TSs, there is no need to move the existing TSs of the 
	             SHDSL frame. The additional TSs will be added AFTER the existing ones, 
	             or in gaps created by E1 TSs removed by user. The main thing is that
				 the existing TSs will NOT be moved and so, their service will not be 
				 damaged by the addition or removal of E1 TS connections.
	 lowTsMapping - the first 2 TSs are used for Signaling (TS16) and Dedicated TS
	             if relevant. The payload starts afterwards, unmapped (according to 
	             E1 connected TSs order). This will ensure that Signaling and 
	             Dedicated TS will continue to function also when new TSs are 
	             connected.	User will still get service breaks when TSs are moved.
	 spareMapping - applicable only for MP-2100/2104 cards. It should be selected only 
	             when working vs. a MP-2100.2104. It resembles the noMapping option,
	             but it contains Spare TSs for unconnected TSs. These Spare TSs 
	             will prevent service breaks upon added connections, because these
	             will be selected from the Spare existing TSs."

    "This object configures the number of TSs of the SHDSL line
     that belong to the 1st Interface of the Far-End device, where
     1st means that these TSs are first on the SHDSL line.

	 It is applicable only for Near-End instance and only when Far-End
	 is an ASMi-52 SA unit having Agent and Mux configuration.
	 SHDSL TSs are arranged so that all TSs of a Far interface are together
	 at the beginning and afterwards all TSs of the other Far interface.
	 The assumption is that only 2 user interfaces exist in the Far End unit.  
	 Examples:
	 - When ASMi-52 has E1+ETH or E1+V.35 user interfaces, this object
	   represents the number of TSs assigned to the E1 interface.
	   They will be first on the SHDSL TSs.
	   Rest of the SHDSL TSs are for the other interface.
	 - When ASMi-52 has ETH+V.35 user interfaces, this object
	   represents the number of TSs assigned to the ETH interface.
	   They will be first on the SHDSL TSs.
	   Rest of the SHDSL TSs are for the V.35 interface.
