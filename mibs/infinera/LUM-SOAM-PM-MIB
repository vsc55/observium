        interval. It is set to true when there is a discontinuity in the
        performance measurements during the Measurement Interval.  Conditions
        for a discontinuity include, but are not limited to the following:

        1 - The local time-of-day clock is adjusted by at least 10 seconds
        2 - The conducting of a performance measurement is halted before the
            current Measurement Interval is completed
        3 - A local test, failure, or reconfiguration that disrupts service
