    DESCRIPTION 
        "The row status of this OTM entry.
                Because rows in this table are indexed by entPhysicalIndex, to create a new row one must
                choose a value of entPhysicalIndex that is not already in use.
        
                A side-effect of the creation of a row in this table is the creation of a corresponding
                row in the eqptTable and the entPhysicalTable.
        
                The status may not be set to active if the otmMoId, otmProvEqptType,  objects are not set 
                to valid values.
        
                This row may only be deleted if it was a pre-provisioned row and the hardware is not present.
        
                If this row is deleted, the associated row in the Eqpt Table and entPhysicalTable will be
                deleted by the agent."
