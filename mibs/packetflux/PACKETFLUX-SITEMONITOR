analogInputEntry OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     analogInputEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Enclosure entry."
    INDEX { analogInputId }
    ::= { sitemonitor 27 }

analogInputId OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     INTEGER
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The id of the analog input."
    ::= { analogInputEntry 1 }

analogInputDescr OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     DisplayString
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the description of this Analog I/O. It can be read and written. The description is limited to 16 characters. We recommend either leaving it as is, or setting it to a better description of what is connected to this I/O point."
    ::= { analogInputEntry 2 }

analogInputSlot OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     DisplayString
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the Slot (Module) number for this Analog I/O. It corresponds to the Slot number in the Expansion Module table. 0 is the base unit, 1 is the first Expansion unit, and so on. It should be noted that the slot number will not necessarily correspond to the physical arrangement of expansion modules."
    ::= { analogInputEntry 3 }

analogInputPosition OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     DisplayString
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the Position Number of this Analog I/O. It will be the same for all identical modules. For instance, position 0 of an analog output module will always correspond to the first analog output. The relation between position and the exact I/O is documented in each expansion module's documentation."
    ::= { analogInputEntry 4 }

analogInputValue OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     DisplayString
    MAX-ACCESS read-write
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This read-write value contains the actual status of the Analog I/O. When reading this value, it will typically correspond to the current status of the Analog I/O. For outputs, writing a value to this OID will cause the output to change to match that value. For inputs, writing to this value will have no effect. It should be noted that many Analog I/O modules will require additional math before the value is usable. For some modules, the value is in tenths or hundredths of the expected unit (for instance voltage might be read as 240 or 2400 for 24 volts)"
    ::= { analogInputEntry 5 }

analogInputPowerOnValue OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     DisplayString
    MAX-ACCESS read-write
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This read-write value contains the status which the Analog Output is set to upon power on. For instance, if you write a value of '100' to this OID, upon power on, the corresponding output will be set to '100'."
    ::= { analogInputEntry 6 }
