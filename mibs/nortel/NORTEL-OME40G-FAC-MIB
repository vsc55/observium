	DESCRIPTION "This is a write-only variable. The user can restore
                 or remove facilities using this command. You restore
                 a facility by setting this variable to IS and remove
                 it by setting it to OOS. During Row-create, a user can 
                 use this variable to set the initial state of the facility.

                 Because this is a write-only variable, the user is expected
                 to read the Primary and Secondary state of the facility
                 to determine the state of the facility. "
